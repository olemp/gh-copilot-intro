introduction to GitHub Copilot

## 1. Prerequisites

To use GitHub Copilot, you will need:

- **Visual Studio Code**: The latest version of VS Code should be installed on your computer. You can download it from [the official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

- **GitHub Copilot License**: A valid GitHub Copilot license is required. This can be requested through the [CompIS service desk](https://computas.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/31).

## 2. Introduction

GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered code assistant that helps developers write better code faster. It uses machine learning models trained on billions of lines of code to suggest whole lines or blocks of code as you type. GitHub Copilot can help with:

- Writing new functions and methods
- Generating unit tests
- Providing code snippets for common patterns
- Suggesting solutions to coding problems
- Reducing repetitive coding tasks

Copilot works alongside you, making suggestions in real-time that you can accept, reject, or modify to fit your needs.

## 3. Modes

GitHub Copilot offers three different modes of interaction to support various development workflows:

### Ask Mode

In Ask Mode, you can ask Copilot questions about your code, programming concepts, or best practices. Simply type your question in the chat panel, and Copilot will provide detailed explanations, code examples, and guidance. This mode is perfect for:

- Learning new programming concepts
- Understanding code behavior
- Getting advice on implementation strategies
- Debugging issues in your code

### Edit Mode

Edit Mode allows you to have Copilot modify your existing code based on your instructions. Select a code block and describe the changes you want, and Copilot will suggest edits that meet your requirements. This mode is ideal for:

- Refactoring existing code
- Optimizing for performance
- Adding error handling
- Converting between different coding patterns or styles

### Agent Mode

Agent Mode empowers Copilot to act as a proactive coding assistant that can perform complex tasks across multiple files. In this mode, Copilot can:

- Create entire features from a high-level description
- Navigate and modify multiple files to implement a solution
- Set up project structures and configurations
- Generate and run tests for your code
- Install dependencies and manage project resources

Agent Mode gives Copilot more autonomy to complete tasks end-to-end, acting as your collaborative coding partner.
