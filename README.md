# Introduction to GitHub Copilot

## 1. Prerequisites

To use GitHub Copilot, you will need:

- **Visual Studio Code**: The latest version of VS Code should be installed on your computer. You can download it from [the official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

- **GitHub Copilot License**: A valid GitHub Copilot license is required. This can be requested through the [CompIS service desk](https://computas.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/31).

## 2. Introduction

GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered code assistant that helps developers write better code faster. It uses machine learning models trained on billions of lines of code to suggest whole lines or blocks of code as you type. GitHub Copilot can help with:

- Writing new functions and methods
- Generating unit tests
- Providing code snippets for common patterns
- Suggesting solutions to coding problems
- Reducing repetitive coding tasks

Copilot works alongside you, making suggestions in real-time that you can accept, reject, or modify to fit your needs.

## 3. Modes

GitHub Copilot offers three different modes of interaction to support various development workflows:

### Ask Mode

In Ask Mode, you can ask Copilot questions about your code, programming concepts, or best practices. Simply type your question in the chat panel, and Copilot will provide detailed explanations, code examples, and guidance. This mode is perfect for:

- Learning new programming concepts
- Understanding code behavior
- Getting advice on implementation strategies
- Debugging issues in your code

### Edit Mode

Edit Mode allows you to have Copilot modify your existing code based on your instructions. Select a code block and describe the changes you want, and Copilot will suggest edits that meet your requirements. This mode is ideal for:

- Refactoring existing code
- Optimizing for performance
- Adding error handling
- Converting between different coding patterns or styles

### Agent Mode

Agent Mode empowers Copilot to act as a proactive coding assistant that can perform complex tasks across multiple files. In this mode, Copilot can:

- Create entire features from a high-level description
- Navigate and modify multiple files to implement a solution
- Set up project structures and configurations
- Generate and run tests for your code
- Install dependencies and manage project resources

Agent Mode gives Copilot more autonomy to complete tasks end-to-end, acting as your collaborative coding partner.

## 4. Basic Usage

Getting started with GitHub Copilot is straightforward. Here's how to use it effectively:

### Installation and Activation

1. Install the GitHub Copilot extension from the VS Code marketplace
2. Sign in with your GitHub account that has an active Copilot license
3. Once activated, Copilot will start analyzing your code and context

### Inline Suggestions

- As you type, Copilot will offer inline code suggestions in gray text
- Press Tab to accept a suggestion or Esc to dismiss it
- Continue typing to get different suggestions
- Use keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Enter or Cmd+Enter on Mac) to see alternative suggestions

### Using Copilot Chat

1. Open the Copilot Chat panel (Ctrl+Shift+I or Cmd+Shift+I on Mac)
2. Type your question or request in natural language
3. View responses in the chat panel
4. Apply suggested code changes directly from the chat

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- Accept suggestion: Tab
- Dismiss suggestion: Esc
- See alternative suggestions: Alt+] or Alt+[
- Open Copilot Chat: Ctrl+Shift+I (Cmd+Shift+I on Mac)
- Trigger inline suggestions: Alt+\ (Option+\ on Mac)

## 5. Limitations

While GitHub Copilot is a powerful tool, it has some important limitations to be aware of:

### Technical Limitations

- **Code Quality Varies**: Copilot may suggest code that looks correct but contains bugs or security vulnerabilities
- **Context Boundaries**: Copilot's understanding is limited to the files you have open and may miss broader project context
- **Documentation Gaps**: Generated documentation may be incomplete or contain inaccuracies
- **Language Support**: Performance varies across programming languages, with stronger support for popular languages like JavaScript, Python, and TypeScript

### Practical Limitations

- **Not a Replacement for Understanding**: Developers should understand the code Copilot generates before using it
- **Review Required**: All generated code should be reviewed for correctness, performance, and security issues
- **Complex Algorithms**: Copilot may struggle with highly specialized algorithms or domain-specific optimizations
- **Project-Specific Conventions**: Copilot may not follow your team's specific coding standards or patterns unless explicitly guided

## 6. Privacy and Security Considerations

Using GitHub Copilot involves important privacy and security considerations:

### Data Usage

- **Code Sharing**: When you use Copilot, snippets of your code may be sent to OpenAI's servers for processing
- **Telemetry**: Usage data is collected to improve the service
- **Training Data**: Your interactions with Copilot may contribute to future model training

### Security Best Practices

- **Sensitive Information**: Avoid using Copilot with code containing sensitive information like API keys, passwords, or personal data
- **Code Review**: Always review generated code for security vulnerabilities
- **Public Code**: Be aware that Copilot might suggest code similar to public repositories
- **Compliance**: Consider whether using AI-generated code complies with your organization's policies and regulatory requirements

### Managing Privacy Settings

- You can adjust telemetry settings in VS Code preferences
- Consider using Copilot in private repositories for sensitive projects
- Use workspace settings to disable Copilot for specific projects or folders that contain sensitive information
