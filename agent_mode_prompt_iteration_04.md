You are an AI Coding Assistant. We are now embarking on **Iteration 4** of the React Time Registry application.

**Context from Iteration 3:**
* The application features enhanced (mock) Google Calendar event interaction with structured mock data and placeholder API functions.
* Users can define their own categories, and these (along with time entries) are potentially persisted using `localStorage`.
* Basic filtering of time entries by category is implemented.
* The UI is componentized (e.g., `App.js`, `TimeLogForm.js`, `TimeLogList.js`, `TimeLogItem.js`) and has improved styling.

**Goal for Iteration 4: Real Data Integration (Read-Only), Core CRUD, and Enhanced Reporting**

For this iteration, please provide the updated React component code. The primary objectives are:
1.  **Initiate Real Google Calendar API Integration (Read Events):** Replace the mock calendar events with actual events fetched from a user's Google Calendar.
2.  **Implement "Edit" Functionality for Time Entries:** Allow users to modify their logged time.
3.  **Add Date Range Filtering for Time Entries:** Enhance reporting by allowing users to view entries within specific periods.
4.  **Improve User Feedback and Error Handling:** Make the application feel more responsive and stable.

**Specific Improvements for Iteration 4:**

**1. Real Google Calendar API Integration (Read-Only for now):**
    * **OAuth Client-Side Setup (Conceptual):**
        * Modify the application to include the Google API Client Library for JavaScript.
        * Implement a "Connect to Google Calendar" button or an automatic prompt on load.
        * Guide the user through the Google OAuth 2.0 flow to grant permission for reading calendar events (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly` scope).
        * **AI Task:** Provide the React component logic for initiating OAuth and handling the token response. Describe conceptually where API keys and Client IDs would be stored/configured (e.g., environment variables for a build process, NOT in client-side code directly). You don't need to implement a backend for OAuth token exchange if a client-side flow is feasible for read-only access, but mention best practices if a backend is typically required.
    * **Fetch Calendar Events:**
        * Replace the `WorkspaceCalendarEventsFromAPI` placeholder. Upon successful authentication, fetch events from the user's primary calendar for a relevant period (e.g., today, or the last/next 7 days â€“ current date is **May 13, 2025**).
        * The fetched events (with at least `id`, `summary` (title), `start.dateTime` or `start.date`, `end.dateTime` or `end.date`) should populate a state variable (e.g., `gcalEvents`).
    * **Display Fetched Events:**
        * Update the `TimeLogForm` to allow users to select from these real fetched calendar events when logging time. Store the actual Google Calendar event ID with the time entry.
    * **Error Handling:** Implement basic error handling for API calls (e.g., display a message if events can't be fetched).

**2. Edit Functionality for Time Entries:**
    * **Edit UI:**
        * In `TimeLogItem.js` (or wherever individual entries are rendered), add an "Edit" button.
        * Clicking "Edit" could either:
            * Populate the main `TimeLogForm` with the details of the entry being edited (and change the form's submit button to "Update Entry").
            * Or, open a modal dialog with a form pre-filled with the entry's details. (A modal might be cleaner but more complex; choose the simpler approach if significantly faster to implement).
    * **Update Logic:**
        * When the "Update Entry" form is submitted, update the corresponding time entry in the `timeEntries` state in `App.js` and persist to `localStorage` if implemented.
    * **State Management for Editing:** You'll need to manage an "editing" state (e.g., `editingEntryId` or `currentEntryToEdit` in `App.js`).

**3. Date Range Filtering for Time Entries:**
    * **Date Picker UI:**
        * Add "Start Date" and "End Date" input fields (HTML5 date inputs: `<input type="date">` are fine for simplicity) to the filter section.
    * **Filtering Logic:**
        * Allow users to select a start and end date.
        * Update the `TimeLogList` to display only time entries whose date falls within the selected range (inclusive). Entries will need a date property; assume new entries are logged for "today" or allow date selection during logging if not too complex. For existing entries without a date, this filter might not apply, or you can default them to a specific date. *For simplicity in this iteration, assume new time entries are for the current date, and the date filter applies to this.*
        * This can be combined with the existing category filter.

**4. Improved User Feedback & Error Handling:**
    * **Loading States:** For the Google Calendar API calls, display a simple loading indicator (e.g., "Loading calendar events...").
    * **Confirmation Messages:** After adding, updating, or deleting a time entry, show a brief success message (e.g., "Entry saved!").
    * **Clearer Error Messages:** If form validation fails or an API call (even mock ones if OAuth isn't fully implemented by AI) fails, provide user-friendly error messages.

**5. Code & Structure:**
    * Further componentize as needed (e.g., `EditTimeLogModal.js` if you choose that route, `DateRangeFilter.js`).
    * Ensure state management in `App.js` is kept as clean as possible, considering the new functionalities. `useReducer` could be an option if `useState` logic becomes overly complex, but only if it doesn't significantly slow down generation.
    * Update `localStorage` persistence to handle any changes in data structures.

**Priorities for this Iteration:**
* Successfully initiating the Google Calendar OAuth flow and fetching/displaying real (read-only) calendar events.
* Implementing the full CRUD operation by adding "Edit" functionality for time entries.
* Adding date range filtering.

**Output Expectation:**
Provide the updated/new JavaScript code for the React component(s) and any necessary modifications to CSS. Clearly detail:
* The client-side steps/components for Google Calendar OAuth and event fetching.
* Conceptual notes on where API keys/Client IDs should be managed (not in the code).
* How the new editing and filtering functionalities are integrated.

This iteration focuses on bringing real-world data and core editing capabilities into the application, making it significantly more robust and useful.
