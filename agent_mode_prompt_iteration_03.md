You are an AI Coding Assistant. We are progressing to **Iteration 3** of the React Time Registry application.

**Context from Iteration 2:**
* The application has an improved UI with a clearer layout and basic styling, likely using components like `TimeLogForm`, `TimeLogList`, and `TimeLogItem`.
* Core functionality includes adding new time entries, deleting existing entries, and basic client-side form validation.
* Data (time entries, predefined categories, mock calendar event titles) is managed in `App.js` using `useState` and is in-memory.

**Goal for Iteration 3: Deeper Integration, Customization, and Basic Reporting**

For this iteration, please provide the updated React component code. The main objectives are:
1.  **Enhanced (Mock) Google Calendar Event Interaction:** Make the selection and association of calendar events more meaningful and prepare the structure for future real API integration.
2.  **User-Defined Categories:** Allow users to add new categories on the fly.
3.  **Basic Filtering for Reporting:** Enable users to filter the displayed time entries by category.
4.  **(Optional but Highly Desirable) Data Persistence:** Implement `localStorage` to save and load time entries and user-defined categories.

**Specific Improvements for Iteration 3:**

**1. Enhanced (Mock) Google Calendar Event System:**
    * **Structured Mock Events:**
        * Modify the `mockCalendarEvents` state in `App.js`. Instead of just strings, make them objects with more details, e.g., `{ id: 'calEvt1', title: 'Team Sync @ 11 AM', start: '2025-05-14T11:00:00', end: '2025-05-14T12:00:00' }`.
        * Include 3-4 such mock events.
    * **Display & Selection:**
        * In the `TimeLogForm`, display these mock calendar events more richly (e.g., "Title - (HH:MM)" ).
        * When a user selects a calendar event to log time against, store the `id` of the mock calendar event with the time entry.
    * **API Preparation (Placeholder Functions):**
        * In `App.js` (or a new utility file, e.g., `services/calendarService.js`), create placeholder async functions:
            * `async function fetchCalendarEventsFromAPI() { /* TODO: Implement actual Google Calendar API call. For now, return a promise resolving to the structured mockCalendarEvents. */ return Promise.resolve(structuredMockCalendarEvents); }`
            * `async function logTimeToCalendarEventAPI(eventId, timeDetails) { /* TODO: Implement API call if needed to update an event or log time on Google's side. For now, just log to console. */ console.log('Mock API: Logging time to event', eventId, timeDetails); return Promise.resolve(); }`
        * Consider using a `useEffect` hook in `App.js` to "fetch" these mock events when the component mounts.

**2. User-Defined Categories:**
    * **Manage Categories State:** The `categories` state in `App.js` will now hold objects, e.g., `{ id: 'cat1', name: 'Project A' }`. Initialize with 1-2 default categories.
    * **Add New Category UI:**
        * In or near the `TimeLogForm`, provide a simple input field and an "Add Category" button.
        * When a user adds a new category, it should be added to the `categories` state (ensure unique IDs, e.g., using a timestamp or a simple counter).
    * **Category Selection:** The category dropdown in `TimeLogForm` should now populate from this dynamic `categories` state.

**3. Basic Filtering for Reporting (in `TimeLogList` or `App.js`):**
    * **Filter UI:** Add a dropdown above the time entries list labeled "Filter by Category."
        * This dropdown should populate with "All Categories" and all available category names from the `categories` state.
    * **Filtering Logic:**
        * Maintain a new state variable, e.g., `selectedCategoryFilter` in `App.js`.
        * When the user selects a category from the filter dropdown, update this state.
        * The `TimeLogList` should then display only the time entries that match the `selectedCategoryFilter` (or all entries if "All Categories" is selected).

**4. (Optional but Highly Desirable) `localStorage` Persistence:**
    * **Save State:** Use `useEffect` hooks in `App.js` to save the `timeEntries` array and the `categories` array to `localStorage` whenever they change.
    * **Load State:** When `App.js` mounts, try to load `timeEntries` and `categories` from `localStorage`. If data exists, use it to initialize the state; otherwise, use the default initial mock data.
        * `JSON.stringify` when saving and `JSON.parse` when loading.

**5. UI & Code Structure:**
    * Integrate these new features smoothly into the existing UI from Iteration 2.
    * Update or create new components as needed (e.g., a `CategoryManager.js` component for adding categories, or a `FilterControls.js` component).
    * Ensure forms are user-friendly and provide clear feedback.

**Priorities for this Iteration:**
* Making the (mock) calendar event integration more robust and API-ready in structure.
* Allowing user-defined categories.
* Implementing the category-based filtering.
* `localStorage` persistence is a strong bonus for usability.

**Output Expectation:**
Provide the updated/new JavaScript code for the React component(s) and any necessary modifications to CSS. Clearly indicate where placeholder API functions should reside.

This iteration aims to add significant depth to the application's core features and prepare it for external data integration.
