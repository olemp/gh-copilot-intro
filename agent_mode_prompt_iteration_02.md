You are an AI Coding Assistant. We are now moving to **Iteration 2** of the React Time Registry application.

**Context from Iteration 1:**
You previously created a minimal MVP React web app with:
* An `App.js` component managing state (time entries, categories, mock calendar events) using `useState`.
* A basic form for manual time entry (task, time, category dropdown, optional mock calendar event association).
* A simple list display of logged time entries.
* All data was in-memory (mock data), and styling was minimal to non-existent.
* The focus was on getting a functional skeleton app generated very quickly.

**Goal for Iteration 2: UI Enhancements & Core Functionality Polish**

For this iteration, please provide the updated React component code (primarily `App.js` and potentially new child components for better structure and UI). The focus is on:
1.  **Improving the User Interface (UI)** for better clarity, usability, and a more professional look.
2.  Adding a few **key functional improvements** to make the app more interactive.
3.  Maintaining the use of **mock data** and in-memory state via `useState`.

**Specific Improvements for Iteration 2:**

**1. UI Enhancements:**
    * **Layout & Structure:**
        * Organize the layout more clearly. Consider a two-column layout (form on one side, list on the other) or a clear top-to-bottom flow with distinct sections.
        * You can achieve this using **CSS Flexbox or Grid**. Please include the necessary CSS. You can either suggest inline styles for simplicity if they are minimal, or provide CSS that would go into an `App.css` file (or a similarly named main CSS file).
    * **Componentization (if beneficial for clarity):**
        * If Iteration 1 was mostly in `App.js`, consider breaking down the UI into smaller, manageable components. For example:
            * `TimeLogForm.js`: For the entry form.
            * `TimeLogList.js`: To display the list of entries.
            * `TimeLogItem.js`: For rendering individual entries in the list (this will also help with the delete functionality).
        * Ensure props are passed correctly from `App.js` (which should still manage the main state).
    * **Styling:**
        * Apply basic styling to form inputs, buttons, and the list to make them visually distinct and easier to use.
        * Improve typography (e.g., clear fonts, consistent sizing for headers vs. content).
        * Ensure adequate spacing and padding.
        * Provide visual feedback for actions (e.g., a button might change appearance slightly on hover/click).
    * **Clarity of Information:**
        * Make sure logged entries are displayed in a clear, readable format. Perhaps use a card-like design for each entry or a well-structured table row.

**2. Functional Enhancements ("Etc."):**
    * **Delete Time Entries:**
        * Each logged time entry in the list should have a "Delete" button.
        * Clicking "Delete" should remove the corresponding entry from the `timeEntries` state in `App.js`.
    * **Basic Form Validation (Client-Side):**
        * Make the "task description" and "time spent" fields required.
        * Ensure "time spent" is a positive number.
        * Display simple validation messages near the respective fields or as a general form message if validation fails (e.g., "Task description is required").
    * **Improved Mock Calendar Event Display (Minor):**
        * When displaying the mock calendar events in the form (e.g., in a dropdown), ensure it's clear.
        * If an entry was associated with a mock calendar event, display this association clearly in the list of logged times.

**3. Code & Structure:**
    * Continue using functional components and React hooks.
    * Ensure the code is clean and readable, with reasonable comments for new logic.
    * If you create new component files, please provide the code for each file.

**Priorities for this Iteration:**
* A noticeably improved and more user-friendly UI is the primary goal.
* The "delete" functionality is the most important functional addition.
* Basic form validation is secondary but highly desirable.

**Output Expectation:**
Provide the updated/new JavaScript code for the React component(s) (e.g., modified `App.js`, new `TimeLogForm.js`, `TimeLogItem.js`, `TimeLogList.js` as needed) and the corresponding CSS (e.g., content for `App.css` or inline styles if more appropriate for speed).

Please ensure the new code integrates the specified UI and functional improvements based on the structure of the Iteration 1 MVP.
